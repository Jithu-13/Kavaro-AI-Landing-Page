I want to build a sleek, premium landing page that captures the visual storytelling of Apple.com while maintaining the simplicity and clarity of Vue.js’s site. The layout should use a centered content container with a maximum width of around 1200 pixels, surrounded by responsive margins that scale down appropriately on smaller screens. The goal is to create a modern, clean design where whitespace enhances visual hierarchy, but the content still feels immersive and rich.

Scrolling should not be hijacked site-wide, but specific sections should trigger animations tied to scroll progress. For example, the hero section could animate in the title and fade in a product image as the user scrolls. Further down the page, I want sections that pin elements (such as a phone or graphic) while text scrolls beside or over it—similar to Apple’s iPhone product pages. These animations should feel smooth and cinematic, ideally powered by GSAP with the ScrollTrigger plugin to manage timing and trigger points precisely. The animations should use hardware-accelerated properties like transform: translate3d and opacity to ensure they perform well across devices.

I want the scrolling behavior to feel responsive and intuitive—no full scroll-jacking, but rather scroll-triggered animations that complement natural browser behavior. If possible, make each major section snap into view using scroll snapping (like scroll-snap-type: y mandatory) to enhance the guided flow. You can optionally use Locomotive Scroll or Lenis to create a smoother scroll experience with inertial motion, similar to the feel you get on Apple’s website.

For structure, build this using either plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or React if it makes the code more maintainable. Use TailwindCSS if you prefer utility classes for layout, spacing, and responsiveness. Start with a base project that includes a full-screen hero section, followed by two or three content blocks with scroll-based animations. Include placeholder text and images that I can replace later.

Finally, I’d like the overall experience to reflect thoughtful visual pacing, where each scroll feels like turning a page in a high-end presentation. Please include a basic GSAP + ScrollTrigger setup and code comments to make it easy to extend. Let’s build the skeleton with this functionality first, and I’ll fill in content and refine the design in later iterations.
