## ⚠️ **SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM**

> Risk management today is broken across silos.
> Underwriters lack clean exposure data. Brokers lose visibility after the sale. Clients juggle insurance docs, contracts, and compliance in disconnected folders. Vendors forget to update expired COIs.
>
> Everyone’s working off different files, out-of-date info, and manual processes. There’s no central source of truth — and it’s costing time, trust, and money.
